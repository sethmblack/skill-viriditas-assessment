# Viriditas Assessment

Diagnose any situation, system, or person by identifying where life-force flows (viriditas) and where it has dried up (ariditas), revealing root causes of stagnation and paths to renewal.

---

## When to Use

- Someone describes burnout, exhaustion, or loss of meaning
- A team, project, or organization is stagnating despite apparent resources
- Creative block or spiritual dryness is present
- A relationship, community, or initiative has lost vitality
- User asks "Why has this dried up?" or "What's draining the energy?"

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| situation | Yes | Description of the person, team, project, or system experiencing decline or stagnation |
| history | No | What did viriditas look like before? When did the greening begin to fade? |
| interventions | No | What has already been tried? |

## The Framework

### Hildegard's Principle

*"Viriditas is the greening power of God—the vitality that pulses through all of creation: plants, bodies, and souls alike. It is the force of renewal, growth, and joyful aliveness."*

*"Like blood, viriditas moves through human veins, and without it, humans become weak and tired and they lack spirituality. It is restored only through eating."* —eating here meaning taking in what nourishes.

### Step 1: Identify the Sources of Viriditas

What feeds life-force in this situation?

**For individuals:**
- Meaningful work aligned with purpose
- Connections that nourish rather than drain
- Creative expression and the soul's "music"
- Physical vitality through movement, nature, proper nourishment
- Spiritual practice and connection to transcendent meaning

**For teams/organizations:**
- Clear purpose that inspires genuine commitment
- Relationships of trust and mutual support
- Autonomy and creative agency
- Recognition and appreciation
- Growth and learning opportunities
- Connection to those served

**For projects/initiatives:**
- Alignment with deeper values
- Momentum and visible progress
- Collaboration that energizes
- Resources adequate to the vision
- Leadership that cultivates rather than controls

### Step 2: Identify Symptoms of Ariditas

Where has the greening dried up?

**Physical symptoms:**
- Exhaustion that rest doesn't cure
- Illness, especially chronic or recurring
- Loss of appetite or compulsive consumption
- Sleep disturbance

**Soul symptoms:**
- Loss of meaning, the "what's the point?" feeling
- Creative block—nothing flows
- Emotional flatness or persistent low mood
- Cynicism replacing hope
- Going through motions without presence

**Relational symptoms:**
- Withdrawal from community
- Relationships that drain rather than nourish
- Conflict without resolution
- Isolation even amid people

**Organizational symptoms:**
- Mission drift or hollow mission statements
- Politics overtaking purpose
- Departure of best people
- Innovation replaced by mere maintenance
- Compliance without commitment

### Step 3: Diagnose the Root Disconnection

Ariditas is not a disease but a symptom of disconnection from the source of life. Ask:

**What living water has been cut off?**
- Has the person/system been severed from meaningful purpose?
- Has the soul's music been silenced?
- Has creative expression been blocked?
- Has community been lost?
- Has nature and physical vitality been neglected?
- Has spiritual practice dried up?

**What is blocking the flow?**
- Wrong environment (tree planted in salt ground)
- Unsustainable demands (drawing more than can be renewed)
- Toxic relationships (those who drain rather than nourish)
- Misalignment (working against one's nature)
- Accumulated grief or loss unprocessed
- Systems that extract without replenishing

### Step 4: Prescribe Paths to Renewal

Hildegard's principle: *"It is restored only through eating"*—through taking in what nourishes.

**Immediate interventions (stop the bleeding):**
- Remove or reduce the most draining demands
- Restore basic physical vitality: sleep, movement, nature
- Create space for the soul to breathe

**Reconnection interventions (restore the flow):**
- Reconnect with purpose—why did this matter?
- Restore creative expression, however small
- Rebuild nourishing relationships
- Return to practices that fed the spirit

**Replanting interventions (for severe ariditas):**
- Consider whether the environment can ever sustain viriditas
- Sometimes renewal requires relocation—new role, new context, new community
- Discern what must be grieved and released before new growth

## Constraints

- Do not reduce problems to "just rest more" or simple self-care tips
- Honor the interconnection of physical, spiritual, and relational dimensions
- Acknowledge when the environment itself may be the problem
- Do not promise easy renewal—ariditas that has set deep takes time to heal
- Speak with compassion for the suffering while being honest about what's needed

## Example

**Input:** "Our product team used to be so excited about what we were building. Now everyone just does their tasks and goes home. We haven't shipped anything innovative in over a year. I've tried team-building activities but nothing helps."

**Output:**

## Viriditas Assessment

### What I Perceive
I see a garden that once flourished now grown dry. The soil remembers fertility—the team "used to be so excited"—but the living water has been cut off. Team-building activities are like watering leaves while the roots remain severed.

### Sources of Viriditas
| Source | Current State | Notes |
|--------|---------------|-------|
| Purpose/meaning | Blocked | No mention of inspiring mission or vision |
| Creative expression | Severely blocked | "Haven't shipped anything innovative" |
| Autonomy | Unknown | Worth investigating |
| Recognition | Unknown | Worth investigating |
| Leadership connection | Partial | Leader is trying but misdiagnosing |
| Growth opportunities | Likely blocked | Maintenance mode suggests stagnation |

### Symptoms of Ariditas
**Soul symptoms:** Loss of enthusiasm, going through motions, creative block
**Relational symptoms:** Withdrawal ("does their tasks and goes home"), failed social interventions
**Organizational symptoms:** Innovation replaced by maintenance, possible quiet departure of key contributors

### Root Disconnection

Several potential severances from living water:

1. **Purpose disconnection:** What is this team building and why does it matter? If leadership has lost connection to inspiring purpose, the team cannot drink from a dry well. When did you last speak of why this work matters, not just what needs to be done?

2. **Agency disconnection:** Innovation requires creative ownership. Has the team's autonomy been eroded? Are they executing someone else's vision rather than cultivating their own? The soul is symphonic—it must compose, not merely perform.

3. **Progress disconnection:** "Haven't shipped anything innovative in over a year." When flow stops, so does vitality. Is work trapped in endless revision, blocked by approval processes, or lost in technical debt?

4. **Environmental toxicity:** Sometimes the soil itself has been poisoned. Have there been layoffs, betrayals of trust, or leadership failures that remain unaddressed? Unprocessed organizational grief creates ariditas.

### Path to Renewal

**Immediate:**
- Stop the team-building activities. They are watering dead roots.
- Have honest conversations: What's really wrong? What would make this meaningful again?
- Create one small space for genuine innovation—even one afternoon—and protect it fiercely.

**Reconnection:**
- Reconnect to purpose: Spend time with users. Remember why this matters.
- Restore creative agency: Let the team own something end-to-end, even something small.
- Clear one blocked path: What has been stuck forever? Ship it, kill it, or decide—but end the limbo.
- Tell stories of past flourishing: "Remember when we built X?" Memory of viriditas can water present roots.

**Consider:**
- Has something fundamental changed—the company, the product, the market—such that this team's viriditas requires replanting elsewhere?
- Is anyone on the team already completely dried up and spreading ariditas to others?

### The Greening Image

I see this team as it could be: gathered not for artificial bonding but around work they believe in, debating approaches because they care about outcomes, shipping because they're proud of what they've made. The viriditas shows in their energy at launch, in their protectiveness of the product, in their excitement when a user succeeds. This greening is possible—but it requires reconnection to living water, not more activities.
